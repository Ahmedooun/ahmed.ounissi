# Hi, I'm Ahmed Ounissi 👋

I am a third-year Computer Engineering student (Bachelor +3) at UTBM. I have been passionate about computer science since middle school, and my goal is to become a software development engineer (I’m almost there!).

The engineering profession offers many international opportunities, which is one of the reasons that motivates me. However, what I truly enjoy is working in a team on challenging projects: thinking together, solving problems, organizing the work to meet deadlines, and finally seeing a project successfully completed as a group. This collaborative and problem-solving aspect is what I enjoy the most in computer science.

🎯 I am currently looking for a 6-month Assistant Engineer internship starting in September 2026. This internship will allow me to gain my first real professional experience. I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I have developed during the past years and to continue growing in a demanding and dynamic environment. I am very excited to start this new chapter of my journey.
